## Style Guidelines

**DO:**
- Be specific about subject matter (birch trees, barn owl, garden gate)
- Describe the feeling/mood (peaceful, mysterious, warm, contemplative)
- Use concrete details (golden light, soft morning mist, intricate branches)
- Write like you're telling a friend about it

**DON'T:**
- Use generic art-speak ("stunning," "breathtaking," "masterpiece")
- Over-hype with too many adjectives
- Make it too formal or stuffy
- Write in all caps or use excessive punctuation

**Tone:** Warm, genuine, grounded. Like an artist who knows their work well, not a salesperson.
